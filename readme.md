The goal of this assignment is to experience one way yo thread a solution. In this assignment, you are to use C++ std::threads to concurrently solve two problems.
 

Part 1) Data Statistics. Part 1 is broken into two sub tasks:

Use std::threads to decrease the execution time of a standard deviation calculation. 
Use std::threads to decrease the execution time of finding and storing the top values in the dataset.
 

Part 2) Matrix-Matrix Multiplication

Use std::threads to decrease the execution time of a matrix-matrix multiplication calculation. In your analysis, the performance of four versions must be compared:

Original unmodified
Original unmodified threaded
Optimized 
Optimized threaded
